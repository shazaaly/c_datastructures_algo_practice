1. Create a new `LinkedList` node called `node` using the `allocateLL` function.
2. If the `list` is empty (i.e., `NULL`), return `node` as the new head of the list.
3. If the `list` is not empty:
     - Initialize a temporary pointer `tmp` with the value of `list`.
     - Traverse the list using a `while` loop until the last node is reached (i.e., `tmp->next` is `NULL`).
     - Update `tmp` to point to the last node of the list.
     - Set the `next` field of the last node (`tmp->next`) to point to `node`, effectively adding `node` as the new last node of the list.
4. Return the original `list`.

Overall, this code snippet adds a new node containing an `H_item` to the end of the linked list. If the list is empty, the new node becomes the head. If the list is not empty, the new node is appended after the last node.
